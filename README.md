# Laura7089's Dotfiles

My most relevant dotfiles organised for use with GNU stow.

To use, clone the repo, then run `stow <tool name>` for each tool whose dotfiles you want to use.
You might need to move/backup your existing dotfiles for some tools.

Thanks to:
- [u/felixsanz](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/69008j/i3gaps_1984/) for base polybar and rofi

## Notes

### Vim

I use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Airline fonts are needed for [`vim-airline`](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) to work.
See [the section in their README](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline#integrating-with-powerline-fonts).

### Zsh

I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as a plugin and theme manager.

### Polybar

Requires a nerdfont or some other font-awesome enabled font to function.
